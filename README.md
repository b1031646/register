<br>
Context
=
<hr>
Document the construction of a Grails application which delivers a RESTful web interface and demonstrates several aspects of the Web Architectures module, including the appropriate use of the  Model-View-Controller design pattern and use of GIT as a code repository (including use of branches to hold development stages and exploratory work).<br>
The system must also demonstrate the use of access to a MySQL database.<br>
<br>
Checking out and running the project
=
<hr>
Some info here about how to run the project<br>
<br>
*The project needs a running local mysql database called registerdb and by default connects to the database using a user called webarch and a password of webarch. Obviously this should be changed in a production environment.<br>
<br>
*The MySQL create database command should be create database registerdb default charset utf8 default collate utf8_bin; The character set encoding is important as the web application is capable of accepting UTF8 input.<br>
<br>
*The project is a groovy/grails project and needs an installed Java7 JDK and installed grails SDK (http://www.grails.org)<br>
